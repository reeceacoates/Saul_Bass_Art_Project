# Saul Bass Art Project

In today’s age of film and cinema, we are seeing a negative trend in movie posters, towards designs that serves the sole purpose of being consumer friendly. They are often seen as only a tool to market the film. This wasn’t always the case; Saul Bass was an iconic designer who revolutionised movie posters in the mid 20th century. He’s known for his bold, minimalist and geometric style, and has contributed to the creation of many company logos we can instantly recognise today. I’m using Processing in Python to recreate and reinterpret his style. This project is meaningful to me because I’m passionate about both film and design, and I want to explore how code can be used as a tool to produce visually striking, artistic posters.

My chosen project type is Visual Art, as my goal is to create geometric poster designs or design elements inspired by Saul Bass. The coding environment I’ve chosen is Processing, with Python as my coding language. I’ve chosen Processing as it is specifically designed for visual art and creative coding. Python is a beginner friendly language to use Processing with. 

These tools will allow me to recreate Saul Bass’ iconic geometric shapes and intricate patterns using relatively simple code. I can also experiment with colour, emulating Bass’ employment of a bright colour palette in his previous works. Processing also allows me to experiment with certain mathematical designs, such as Bass’ spiral employed in the “Vertigo” movie poster.
